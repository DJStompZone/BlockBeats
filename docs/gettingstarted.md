# Getting Started with Block Beats

Block Beats is an innovative Minecraft Bedrock Edition mod that enables players to bring custom audio into their worlds using redstone mechanics. Follow this guide to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Required Experimental Features

Block Beats utilizes cutting-edge features from the 1.17.0-Beta server and 1.4.0-Beta server-ui APIs. To enable these features, make sure the following experimental toggle is activated in your world settings:

## Resource Pack
Block Beats includes a custom resource pack, which is essential for playing your audio files. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

- Adding Your Audio Files:
Place your custom audio files in the resource pack. Detailed steps can be found in the Audio Documentation section.

- Applying the Pack:
Ensure the resource pack is applied to your world, realm, or server before you start. This is a critical step for the mod to access your audio files.

## Behavior Pack
The behavior pack is another essential component of Block Beats. It includes:

- Custom Jukebox Block:
A new block called RecordBox (ID: RecordBox) is added to your game. This block allows you to interact with your custom audio using redstone.

- Scripting Integration:
All the scripting required to make the mod functional is contained within this pack.

!> Applying the Packs
Make sure both the Resource Pack and the Behavior Pack are installed and applied.

With everything in place, you're ready to explore the possibilities of custom soundscapes in Minecraft using Block Beats.
