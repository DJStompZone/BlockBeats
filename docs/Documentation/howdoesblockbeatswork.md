## How does block beats work?
### At A Glance
Block Beats adds a new custom version of the jukebox block, this block has a few custom block compentants running on it when placed in the world. When a player intracts withthe block they are presented with a UI that allows them to set some properies on the block these are: 
- The name of the audio file
- The length of the audio file
- A Toggle that enables looping of the Audio file.

When the block is powered via redstone it will start to play the audio file, this allows players to add custom audio redstone farms, buildings and mini games. When the power is removed it will stop playing the sound.

!> Multiple files can be played simultaneously, but the same file cannot be played more than once at the same time. For example, you can play both track1 and track2 at the same time, but you cannot play two instances of track1 simultaneously.
